# Alek's New Tab Dashboard

So, this is a project I've been wanting to do for a while, but never really got
the time to do it. Well, I decided to make time and to do and open source.
Plenty of things left to do, but I made some architectural decisions that should
make everything easy to implement.

## Architecture

Uses Redux and a persistent storage solution with rehydration, custom modal
solution, custom "design system" (if you can call it that lmao).

## How to develop

Run:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

and put the `build` folder in your chrome extensions as an unpacked extension.

## Future

I plan on releasing this as a full on extension, just gotta figure out what
people want to put in here. If you have something, open issues or contact me.
